I have a personal rule. Whenever I'm taking a shower, if I so much as think about turning the water to freezing cold and sitting under it for x amount of time, I have to do it.  

If you've ever tried taking a cold shower, the conversation in your head has probably gone something like:

'Should I take a cold shower? I've heard it's super good for you.'

'warm water tho' 

'Come on, don't be a bitch, it's just some cold water'

'but why, it's stupid'

etc. etc.

I have this conversation every time, but the rule I set always wins. I'm not sure why in this case it's hard to make excuses, maybe because it's an absolute kind of thing. 

So now my goal is to set that same rule for everything else that's uncomfortable or initially difficult. 

The bias to action in spite of the lizard screaming about how bad it's going to be is super valuable, and one of my main goals is to cultivate that.
