I've been seeing a lot of debate about the United States COVID-19 mitigation strategy, and I think that this is an important conversation to have.

However, there are clearly people on both sides who are purely misinformed and are bringing up false claims in order to prove their point.
I think this is dangerous, because it steers the conversation away from what actually matters; how can we get through this with the least amount of death and suffering?

1. Economy = Stock Market. This is just false, and I see them conflated quite frequently. The stock market is a place where people can buy or sell shares of a company, and these share prices go up or down based on what other people think about the company. The economy is the collection of all transactions that humans make, buying food, going to the movies, getting a paycheck, etc. The economy and society are deeply intertwined, and that's why we're able to live the lives we do today.
2. The models said 1.7 million deaths and now we're at 70,000: therefore this isn't a problem. This has gotta be one of the worst takes of all time. The 1.7 million number is based on what would happen if nothing was done, and we as a society decided that wasn't okay, so we enacted lockdowns and social distancing, etc.
3. Anything that mentions any sort of death rate. This is unknown. You can't actually measure the death rate, because you don't know how many people have been infected. Any argument on either side that mentions the death rate should be tossed out. 
4. Test accuracy - Another big unknown.
