I remember listening to a podcast with Jocko Willink, and his philosophy is that the more disciplined you are, the more discipline you have. He was pushing back against the idea of 'decision fatigue', and I remember at the time I thought he was wrong. Decision Fatigue is definitely a thing, it's hard to make a lot of decisions throughout the day.

It's been maybe a year since I heard him say this, and I think I've obtained some additional clarity. Discipline and decision making are two related, but different things. 

Let's define discipline as doing things that don't feel great. Maybe that's getting up early, going to the gym, not eating that birthday cake, etc. These are things where you have to sacrifice the short term for the long term. Jocko's argument, as I understand it, is that if you get up early it's easier to go to the gym. Exercising discipline once gives you the win and more ability to exercise it again.

Now, let's talk about decision fatigue. Steve Jobs was famous for only wearing one outfit, as some sort of decision fatigue hack or something. This is definitely something you can feel. Picking a restaurant after a long day seems hard, deciding what to wear for a night out, etc.

So the question is, what's happening here? How can it be easier to go to the gym after waking up but harder to decide what shoes to wear. I think there are a couple things at play here. Discipline is exerting a lot of willpower to overcome some sort of mental barrier, but once that barrier is overcome the willpower need drops away quickly, and you feel good about what you've done. It doesn't take discipline to stay in the gym after you're under a barbell. However, there's a lot less urgency when it comes to picking an outfit. The stakes are low, but in your head red shoes vs blue shoes is just as much a decision as voting for a red senator vs blue senator. 

What this tells us is that any time you can exert a lot of willpower just once to eliminate a decision you can get the best of both worlds. Deciding once that you're not going to buy food with added sugar gets rid of the debate. 

I'm really not happy with this riff.
