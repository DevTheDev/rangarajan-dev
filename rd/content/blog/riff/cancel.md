If you go on twitter or anywhere on the internet, you'll see masses of people railing against cancel culture.

You'll see even more people hopping on the train of cancelling whatever celebrity did something mildly interesting.

Here's the problem. Cancel Culture suppresses the wrong people.

What started as a great movement to out people who had abused their power turned into one of the greatest tools for demagogues like Donald Trump. Trump's core competency is attention. He's elite at saying whatever it takes to get eyeballs on him. That's how he built a political party and secured the republican nomination in 2016, despite being totally different from any other political candidate.

No such thing as bad press really applies to these situations. Even if 9/10 people disagree with someone, when you show them to 10 million people they still gain a million new fans. That's why cancel culture doesn't work, especially as it gets more petty and smaller. 

Controversy is the precursor to attention. 

Not only does cancel culture help the very people it tries to destroy, it hurts the people that should be benefitting from it. The people who are now scared by the mob probably have something worth hearing. Cancelling someone is essentially rewarding them for being in a position that they can be controversial. The incentives only align if they have people around them who care about perception.

Now, the real question, why does this matter? The biggest point I want to make here is that if you're the person who's afraid to share your view, you probably shouldn't be. 

This sounded better in my head.
