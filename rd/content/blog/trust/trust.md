When you tell yourself "I'm going to do x", and then you do it, you build trust in yourself.

For example, you probably trust yourself to drive to the store, or to call an uber.

You've probably never said "I'm going to call an uber home" and then flaked out of doing it. Why? Because it's so easy that not doing it would actually be harder.

Everyone has said they were going to do something and then not done it, even if it's something small. Maybe you forgot, or your emotional state changed.

Now think about other people. You probably have a friend you'd trust to pick you up at the airport, or someone who you trust will be fun to bring to a party. You don't need to worry, they'll behave predictably.

When you have that trust, the decision making process is easy, because there's no need for the expensive verification step. 

Verification is hard, there are so many fakes and phonies. It's an expensive process. Most of sales is demonstrating that you pass their verification.

When you don't need to verify, when you trust, things happen fast.

Build processes, rules, and teams that you trust, and you won't need to verify. Spend tons of time automating something to your standards and you'll be able to set it and trust it. Trust yourself, and your whole life will change.

Trust equals speed.
